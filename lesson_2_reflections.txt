What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates a hidden directory structure and files, which are ready to
	store files. Cannot do git version control without it.

How is the Staging Area different from the Working Directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The Working Directory is the "home" location of files which may or may not be
	included in the repository, and it is also the home of the repository. The
	repository is the "holder" of committed files and their various versions.
	The Staging Area is a temporary holder of files which are ready to be
	committed, but have not yet been committed. Upon "commit", all files in the
	Staging Area go into the Repository together.

	This allows files which are related to each other, and which together may
	relate to a specific change, to be included in the same new version in the
	Repository.
