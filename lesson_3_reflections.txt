When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you're collaborating with others (so you can have a central location for keeping code)
  or when you're working on your own but want to share your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  There may be changes committed to the repository which aren't ready to be published
  or aren't ready to be added to other branches. If Git automatically pulled those
  that could cause problems.
